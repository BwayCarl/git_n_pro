        <!-- BIO -->
        <p>I am a Local One union stagehand working on Broadway for the last 25 years and currently the House Electrician
            at the Booth Theatre located on Shubert Alley and 45th Street. While I know that my job will eventually come back after 
            the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm seeing this foray into web coding as an attempt to reinvent myself as I look to begin a 
            second career.
        </p>
        <p>Fun facts: I studied music in college, I love jazz, I'm an avid New York Mets fan, and have been teaching myself 
            to play guitar for the last year or so. I was born in the Bronx, raised in Flushing, Queens and have lived in South Orange, 
            New Jersey for the last 10 years with my wife Maria and my two daughters Zoe, age 10, and Ana, age 7.
        </p>
